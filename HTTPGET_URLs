# This is a simple list of the HTTP URLs that have been observed during the use of the Android app to
# connect to a BlackVue camera directly.
#
# Note that the Cloud connectivity is different; the URLs in this file have to be accessed via a wifi
# client connected directly to the camera.
#
# The camera appears to take IP address 10.99.77.1 and present an address within 10.99.77.0/24 to the client
# - at least on my camera - please change this if you observe otherwise.
# Only one wifi/DHCP client can connect at any one time.

# Alive check - confirm BlackVue version
